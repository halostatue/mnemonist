# Mnemonist Changelog

## 1.0.1 / 2026-01-25

- Fixed tests. We were using a single language in Trezor seed tests instead of
  testing all languages. This expanded the number of tests from ~300 to ~2500.

- Added [usage rules](./usage-rules.md) for use with [`usage_rules`][urules].

  The usage rules were built with the assistance of [Kiro][kiro].

## 1.0.0 / 2025-08-25
