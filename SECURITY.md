# Mnemonist Security

## LLM-Generated Security Report Policy

Absolutely no security reports will be accepted that have been generated by LLM
agents.

## Supported Versions

Security reports are accepted only for the most recent major release and the
previous version for a limited time after the initial major release version.
After a major release, the previous version will receive full support for three
months and security support for an additional three months (for a total of six
months).

Mnemonist supports the three most recent versions of Elixir and supported
[Erlang/OTP versions][otp-versions].

As of August 2025, the support list is:

| Elixir | Erlang         |
| ------ | -------------- |
| 1.16   | 24†, 25, 26    |
| 1.17   | 25, 26, 27     |
| 1.18   | 25, 26, 27, 28 |

The oldest version of Elixir will not be soft-deprecated until six months after
the release of a new version of Elixir.
